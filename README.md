# js13k Webpack Starter

## What is it?

This project aims to be a foundation for creating a game for the [js13k](http://js13kgames.com/) game competition. As such it provides tools such as a development server, automatic code minification and archive creation.

## List of features

1. JS & CSS minification
1. Code inlining (the entire application is a single `index.html` file)
1. Development server with source maps
1. Generation of submission files (including the `.zip` file)
1. *ES2018* module support through webpack
1. Tree shaking and module concatenation

## How can I get started?

The first thing you need to do is make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) installed. Then clone the project and in the root directory run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install all the required dependencies for developing the project. After the installation finishes you will be able to run the included npm scripts.

## How can I start the development server?

After going through the installation just run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will setup a server listening at `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Access from another device

You can pass an argument to the development server specifying the interface to listen on.
```
npm start -- --host=0.0.0.0
```
This command will start the development server listening on all interfaces. Having a device on the same network you will be able to view the webpage at `http://[yourLocalIP]:8080` for example `http://192.168.1.1:8080`.

## How can i generate files for submission?

This project provides a npm script for building your application. Just run:
```
npm run build
```

This will generate two files `index.html` and `build.zip` both located in the `dist/` folder. The zip file contains only the generated `index.html`. The output from the command also tells you how large is the generated zip file.

## Where does my code go?

All your javascript files should be located in the `src/app/` directory. The entry point is the `main.js` file. All your css should be located in the `src/styles` directory. The entry point is `main.css`. If you need to modify the html file, you can find the template used in `src/index.html`.

This project uses webpack for module bundling. This means that all the files that you want to use should be imported directly or indirectly by either `main.js` or `main.css`.

The project used before `html-webpack-inline-source-plugin` on the version `0.0.10` but it has a bug. For now, [there is a workaround](https://github.com/DustinJackson/html-webpack-inline-source-plugin/issues/79#issuecomment-673489454) using the version `1.0.0-beta.2`.

## ES2015+ support

This repository used to include [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to enable working with modern JavaScript. As time progresses however the browser support for modern JS became excellent and webpack began shipping a newer version of ~uglify~ terser that can minify it. All of this makes it a rational choice to omit Babel as it would only increase the overall bundle size.
